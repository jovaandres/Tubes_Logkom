## General Information
This is Farm Fimulation Role-Playing Game built with the declarative programming language Prolog. There are three main activites:
- farming - produce corn, tomato, carrot, and potato
- ranching - produce milk, wool, and eggs
- fishing - get tuna, mackeral, and salmon

Players will get new quests that must be completed in each level. Gold can be obtained when the player sells the items he has. Basically, each role (fisherman, rancher, farmer) can do all activities. However, players will get a bonus reward of 20 golds if they do activities that match their role. The goal state of this game is when the player has 20000 golds. If the player fails to collect 20000 golds within 1 year, the player will lose (fail state).
